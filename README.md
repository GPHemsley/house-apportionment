# House Apportionment

Allocate seats in the U.S. House of Representatives according to the following algorithms:
* [Reapportionment Act of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapportionment_Act_of_1929) – proportional allocation of 435 seats
* [Wyoming Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Rule) – proportional allocation of a number of seats such that the ideal ratio of population per seat is equal to the population of the constituency with the smallest population
* [cube root rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_root_rule) – proportional allocation of a number of seats equal to the smallest whole number greater than the principal cube root of the total population
